repository:**\n","\n","   ```bash\n","   git clone https://github.com/your_username/song-genre-classification.git\n","   cd song-genre-classification\n","   ```\n","\n","2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**\n","\n","   ```bash\n","   python -m venv venv\n","   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n","   ```\n","\n","3. **Install dependencies:**\n","\n","   ```bash\n","   pip install -r requirements.txt\n","   ```\n","\n","4. **Install Spleeter (if you plan to use source separation):**\n","\n","   Refer to the [Spleeter documentation](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) for installation instructions. You might need to install TensorFlow separately depending on your setup.\n","\n","## Dataset Preparation\n","\n","1. Place your audio files in the `data/raw` directory.\n","2. Ensure your data is organized by genre in subdirectories (e.g., `data/raw/blues`, `data/raw/classical`).\n","3. Run the `01_data_preparation.ipynb` notebook to process and organize your dataset.\n","\n","## Training\n","\n","1. **Feature Extraction:** Run `02_feature_extraction.ipynb` to extract features from your dataset.\n","2. **Classical Model Training:** Run `03_model_training_classical.ipynb` to train a classical model (e.g., RandomForest).\n","3. **Deep Learning Model Training:** Run `04_model_training_deep_learning.ipynb` to train a deep learning model (e.g., CNN).\n","\n","   *Note: You can choose to train either or both types of models.*\n","\n","## Prediction\n","\n","To make predictions on new audio files:\n","\n","1. Place the new audio file in a designated directory.\n","2. Use the functions in `src/inference.py` to load the model and make predictions.\n","3. See `05_inference_example.ipynb` for an example of how to use the inference module.\n","\n","## Web App\n","\n","To run the web application:\n","\n","```bash\n","streamlit run app.py\n","```\n","\n","The app will open in your browser, allowing you to upload audio, perform source separation, visualize spectrograms, and get genre predictions.\n","\n","## Colab\n","\n","A Google Colab notebook (`colab_notebook.ipynb`) is provided for running the project in a cloud environment. This is particularly useful for training deep learning models on GPUs.\n","\n","## Audio Input Handling\n","\n","The project is designed to handle various audio formats and lengths. The `src/audio_processing.py` module provides functions for loading, resampling, and segmenting audio.
